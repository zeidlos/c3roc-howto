      <h2>Radio Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Radios are a great way to pass information to a larger group of people. Especially if it comes to coordinating flow of people, giving updates about the space left in a lecture room etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        However the usage of radios requires some discipline, otherwise it will get very chaotic very quickly, which we can't have it on our comms nets. Keep in mind, that there are potentially 60+ people listening to what you say.
      </p>
      <p>
        Altough this howto is written in english to be more inclusive, most communication on the radio is been done in german.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case of trouble with the device you can ask Heaven or can reach us via radio on channel 1 or via DECT (1762 = 1ROC).
      </p>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Do only transmit if it is of relevance to more than one person or you can't reach the person on DECT/Cellphone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do think before you transmit and formulate your transmission. Speak as clearly as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Those are radios, not megaphones. Please speak in a normal voice, even in loud environments. If your voice is very loud, it will be distorted on the receiving end and no one will understand what you say.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't interrupt other people having a conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask for the person you are calling and await their clearance to avoid unneccessary re-transmissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your radio beeps to signal that you can talk now. Please wait another second or two to prevent cutting off the first, most important part.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please do watch the video we've provided for you for a deeper understanding on why and how.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please do keep your radio tidy, don't litter it with stickers. :)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Callsigns</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a radio it means you fill a special position or role. Because most likley noone knows that you are the security-angel at the door, you should use „Eingang Glashalle“ as your callsign, not your real name or your nickname.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to reach a special person, you might as well use DECT/Cellphone unless you're trying to reach a coordinator/heaven and the conversation is intresting to others as well.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Battery exchange stations
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heaven (CCL)
        </li>
        <li>
          CERT (Glashalle)
        </li>
        <li>
          LOC (Halle 4)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hint: To check your battery status, press the button below the big push to talk button. Then the LED will indicate your battery status (green: full, orange: still full enough, red: please change battery). Please check your battery status frequently, but at least at the beginning of your shift.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Basic Communication Protocol</h2>
      <p>
        Radio communication should follow a basic protocol to ensure a smooth operation and prevent unneccessary retransmissions.
      </p>
      <h3>Init Phase</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sender: "&lt;receiver&gt; for &lt;sender&gt;" or <em>"Alice (for) Bob“</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            Receiver: "&lt;receiver&gt; go ahead" or <em>"Here is Bob, go ahead"</em>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          If you don't receive that answer, &lt;receiver&gt; apparently is busy or not listening. In this case you can retry after 10 seconds. If &lt;receiver&gt; is just busy but listening, he will tell you. After each call, roughly multiply the interval with 5.
      </p>
      
      
      <h3>Communication Phase</h3>
      Just talk to each other as you would normally. No need to use callsigns within an allready established communication unless there are more parties involved.
      
      <h3>Ending phase (optional but helpful)</h3>
      <p>One or the other ends the conversation with the keywords „&lt;name&gt; out“.</p>
      <p>This is important, so others know that the channel is free again. If a communication has been paused for some time, callsigns have to be called again. After a minute you can assume the conversation as timed out and start a new one. Until a conversation has been terminated, there is no other communication to be started.</p>
      
      <h2>A little more detail</h2>
      <p>These are the steps you should ideally follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Think </li>
        <li>Formulate </li>
        <li>Rethink </li>
        <li>(Reformulate)</li>
        <li>push the button </li>
        <li>wait for the beep</li>
        <li>wait a second</li>
        <li>talk</li>
        <li>release the button.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        As this seems very obvious, I can tell you: It's not and in the haste of the events, the thinking and formulating part often takes place after hitting the transmit button. Also the beginn is cut off, because you didn't wait after hitting PTT.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Also DECT might be the better choice in some cases. There you can talk in private and won't steal anyones airtime and attention.
